    <h2>Bio</h2>
    
    <p>The band began as a project between childhood friends Taylor Meier and Evan Westfall, who met at a summer camp while they were middle school students. Meier and Westfall graduated from Upper Arlington High School in 2012. In 2013 Taylor began playing in coffee shops around Athens while studying at Ohio University. They later added bass player Matt Vinson and Joseph Kavalec on the keyboards.</p>
